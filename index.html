    <p> There are a variety of things that I could put here. They include: </p>
    <ul> 
    	<li> The exact same thing in the example </li>
    	<li> Something entirely unrelated </li>
    	<li> Something somewhere in between </li>
    </ul>
    <p> They would all be equally acceptable if my understanding of the assignment is correct. </p>
    <p> I am going to link to <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/"> Mozilla Manifesto</a> because that is what they link to in the example. </p>
